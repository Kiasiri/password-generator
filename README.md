# password-generator
The assignment was to make a password generator in js.
I made all available characters into variables in strings.
I made confirms to ask whether a specific character type is wanted if answered yes then that string would be concated to the default lowercase string lines 32-34.
I used a prompt to get a pass length that I changed from a strin into a number that I put into a for loop that chose randomly from the available characters array for each character until the length number was reached.
These characters are what the function returns and what is displayed.
